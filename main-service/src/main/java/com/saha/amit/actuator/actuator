URL exposed by default by actuator --> http://localhost:8080/mainService/actuator/health
When some connection like rabbit MQ is down its returns as {"status":"DOWN"}  even tough app is up

For other URL have to explicitly allow health will be exposed by default, but if we are adding explicit endpoint then have to mention health also to access /health
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=info
or
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*  //for all
management.info.env.enabled=true

For excluding
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=info

info will return anything mentioned in below format
info.app.name= Hello
info.app.description= Hello
info.app.version= 1
info.app.president=Amit
